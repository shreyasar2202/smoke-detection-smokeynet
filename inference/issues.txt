1. Need to import numpy, opencv, and Pillow into Lambda Layers
    However, it is capped  at 250mb for 5 layers
2. Need to run lambda function as a docker container which supports <= 10 GB

3. OpenCV caused issues on Docker when importing. The Amazon Base OS Image does not have mesaLibgl
which OpenCV depends on. This caused a lot of issues in tracing the error since the error messages
that we got werent' really helpful
